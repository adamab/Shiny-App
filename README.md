# Shiny-App
This repo will house the ui.R and server.R files for the shiny app that predicts mpg based on three attributes of a car. It uses the number of cylinders, horse power, and number of gears for its prediction. This is a simple linear model that has not been rigorously analyzed for accuracy. The intent of this model is to demonstrate the ability to predict using inputs from shiny.
